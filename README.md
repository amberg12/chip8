# chip8
 
This is an implementation of a Chip-8 emulator, that is largely complete.
However, it does not account for all of the quirks, plus that the emulator
runs at is not controlled at all.

## Building

To build, simple run `cargo build --release`

## Running

To run a program, pass the file path of the ROM you would like to run in the
command line.
